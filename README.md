# Design Patterns
###### The purpose of this project is to document algorithms implementation, whose can be used as guide for the understanding of *design patterns*.

## Strategy

It is used when many related classes differ only in their behavior. Strategies provide a manner to configure a class with one among many behaviors.

Strategy pattern defines a family of algorithms, incapsulating each one and makes them interchangeable. It lets the algorithm very independently from the clients that use it.

## Observer

The observer pattern defines an one to many dependency between objects, so that when an object changes its state all of its dependencies are notified and updated automatically.

## Decorator

It is used to add responsibilities to individual objects dynamically, without affect other objects.

The decorator pattern attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. It provides a flexible alternative to extend functionalities.

## Factory Method

The Factory Method defines an interface for creating an object, but lets the subclasses to decide which class to instantiate.

## Abstract Factory

Abstract Factory is a set of Factory Methods, so abstract factory makes use of multiple factory methods. 

The Abstract Factory pattern provides an inteface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifing their concrete classes.
