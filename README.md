# Design Patterns
###### The purpose of this project is to document algorithms implementation, whose can be used as guide for the understanding of *design patterns*.

## Strategy

It is used when many related classes differ only in their behavior. Strategies provide a manner to configure a class with one among many behaviors.

Strategy pattern defines a family of algorithms, incapsulating each one and makes them interchangeable. It lets the algorithm very independently from the clients that use it.

## Observer

The observer pattern defines an one to many dependency between objects, so that when an object changes its state all of its dependencies are notified and updated automatically.

## Decorator

It is used to add responsibilities to individual objects dynamically, without affect other objects.

The decorator pattern attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. It provides a flexible alternative to extend functionalities.
